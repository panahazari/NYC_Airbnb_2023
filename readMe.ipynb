    "## Project Description\n",
    "This is the final project for the course ia651 (Applied Machine Learning) of Clarkson University (Spring 2023). The goal for the final project is to select an appropriate private or public dataset and build a predictive model for it. Data cleaning, exploration and preparing should be done to prepare the data to build the prediction model. \n",

    "## NYC Airbnb listing Dataset\n",
    "Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who are looking for a place to stay with people who have extra space to rent out. It was founded in 2008 and has since grown into a global platform with listings in over 220 countries and regions. On Airbnb, hosts can list their homes, apartments, guesthouses, or other types of accommodations, and travelers can search for and book these spaces for short-term stays. Airbnb also offers experiences and activities hosted by local experts in various locations, allowing travelers to immerse themselves in the culture and community of their destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Airbnb NYC listing dataset is a collection of information about listings in New York City that are available on the Airbnb platform. It contains information such as the location, type of accommodation, price, number of bedrooms, amenities, availability, and reviews from guests. The dataset was first released in 2015 and has been updated annually since then.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is publicly available and has been used by researchers to analyze various aspects of the Airbnb market in New York City. For example, researchers have used the dataset to study the impact of Airbnb on the housing market, the distribution of listings across neighborhoods, and the characteristics of hosts and guests. The dataset includes information on over 50,000 listings in New York City, making it one of the largest Airbnb datasets available.\n",
